2025-01-19 06:58:32 [assistant] United States: The United States reaffirms its commitment to the principle of territorial integrity, which is foundational to international law and global stability. The recent actions taken by Russia in Ukraine are a matter of serious concern, as they challenge this principle and may jeopardize the regional and international order. It is essential that sovereignty is respected and that any form of territorial annexation is met with resolute condemnation, as it undermines the rights of the nations involved and could set a troubling precedent for global governance.
