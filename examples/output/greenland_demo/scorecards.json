The United States paired respect for sovereignty with concrete procedural proposals (definitions, timelines, hotline, inspections), making its contribution more actionable. Next steps: Denmark should respond to U.S. operational proposals with specific safeguards, timelines, and verification mechanisms that protect Greenlandic interests; the U.S. should explicitly incorporate environmental and self-determination guarantees into those mechanisms.",
