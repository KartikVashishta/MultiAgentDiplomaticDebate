Denmark shall seek the prior consultation and written consent of the Government of Greenland for any access, temporary deployment in excess of 30 days, sustained activities expected to cumulatively exceed 90 days in a calendar year, or any proposal for permanent basing. No access or basing that involves construction of new facilities, significant environmental modification, or long-term land use shall commence without Greenlandic consent.\n\nReview of Framework: Within 12 months of signature, Denmark and NATO shall complete a joint review of the 1951 defense framework as it applies to Greenland and produce an agreed, public summary of any proposed updates to basing, command relationships, and legal arrangements. Proposed changes to the 1951 framework will be submitted for consultation with the Government of Greenland and presented to NATO for decision-making consistent with alliance processes.\n\nNotification & Approval Timelines: For planned temporary access (deployments that will not exceed 180 days per site), the requesting NATO/United States authority shall provide written notification to the Danish Ministry of Defence and the Government of Greenland at least 30 calendar days prior to mobilization, including purpose, scope, duration, force composition, and environmental risk assessment. For short rotations (30 days or less) notification shall be provided at least 7 calendar days prior. Denmark will render an initial acceptance/conditional acceptance/denial in writing within 21 calendar days of receiving a materially complete notification. Requests that require Greenlandic consent shall have Greenland\u2019s response incorporated within Denmark\u2019s decision in the same 21\u2011day period whenever possible; if Greenland requests additional time, Denmark will allow up to 30 additional days, except in emergencies.\n\nEmergency & Hostile Operations Exception: In the case of imminent hostile threats or urgent emergency operations necessary to protect life, safety, or to respond to external attack, NATO/U.S. forces may deploy immediately. In such cases the deploying authority shall provide immediate oral notification (within 4 hours) and a complete written notification within 72 hours to Denmark and Greenland. Retrospective approval shall be sought within 72 hours; if Denmark/Greenland withhold retrospective approval, the deploying force shall take immediate remedial actions agreed in an expedited joint meeting (see Compliance & Enforcement). Any emergency deployment authorizations will be narrowly tailored and time limited to the duration of the emergency as determined jointly.\n\nDe\u2011confliction, Hotline & Incident Protocols: A 24/7 diplomatic\u2011military hotline and secure communication channel shall be established and maintained among the Danish Ministry of Defence, the Government of Greenland (designated crisis contact), and NATO's designated regional command to support planning, de\u2011confliction, and immediate incident reporting. All incidents involving injury, environmental harm, or potential escalation shall be reported to the hotline within 2 hours of awareness. For reported incidents, the parties shall initiate a joint fact\u2011finding process within 48 hours and agree on measures to de\u2011escalate and remediate within 7 days.\n\nOversight, Inspections & Legal Jurisdiction: Denmark retains the right to conduct annual inspections of all facilities and activities associated with U.S./NATO presence. Greenlandic representatives shall be afforded the opportunity to participate in inspections affecting their jurisdiction or communities. NATO personnel operating in Greenland shall remain subject to Danish criminal and civil law unless otherwise agreed in a separate Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA); a draft SOFA shall be tabled within 6 months of signature. Inspection protocols shall protect operational security while ensuring meaningful oversight; procedures for classified inspections shall be agreed in advance.\n\nCompliance, Enforcement & Dispute Resolution: Violations of this clause or conditions attached to access shall trigger immediate suspension of the relevant activity or access pending a joint review. Denmark shall notify NATO and the United States in writing of any suspension; a trilateral review (Denmark, Greenland, NATO/United States) shall be convened within 30 days to assess the violation and agree remedial measures. Where remedial action is not agreed within 60 days, the suspension shall continue until resolution. For unresolved disputes, the parties will refer the matter to an expedited arbitration panel composed of one appointee each from Denmark, Greenland, and NATO (selected within 15 days of referral) whose decision shall be issued within 90 days and be binding on operational access while preserving sovereign rights.\n\nEnvironmental & Indigenous Safeguards: No approval for permanent basing or deployments exceeding 30 days shall be granted without an independent environmental impact assessment (EIA) adhering to agreed standards (see Clause on Environmental Safeguards) and documented consultation with affected Indigenous communities. Remediation and mitigation plans, and financial assurances to cover environmental harm and site restoration, must be in place prior to commencement of works.\n\nTransparency & Reporting: NATO and Denmark shall publish an annual consolidated report summarizing numbers, types, and durations of U.S./NATO activities in Greenland, subject to protection of legitimately classified information. The report shall also record incidents, inspections, and remedial actions taken.\n\nImplementation & Review: This clause is effective on signature. Draft SOFA provisions, inspection protocols, and the hotline implementation plan shall be completed within 6 months. The first comprehensive review of implementation shall occur 12 months after signature; thereafter, the parties shall review this clause biennially or sooner by mutual agreement.",

No license that authorizes extraction, processing, or long\u2011term offtake may be granted without documented consent from the Government of Greenland for activities occurring in Greenlandic territory or affecting Greenlandic communities. Licensing decisions shall be made by a designated licensing authority with clear written procedures and timelines.\n\nApplication, Decision Timelines & Transitional Arrangements: A materially complete license application shall receive a preliminary accept/conditional accept/deny response within 90 calendar days. Where additional information is requested, the 90\u2011day clock pauses until a complete submission; final decisions shall be made within 180 calendar days of a complete submission. Existing permits and projects in active production at the time of signature shall be reviewed under these standards within 12 months and operators shall present compliance transition plans within 6 months.\n\nLicensing Criteria & Conditions: Licenses shall be granted only where the applicant demonstrates, to the satisfaction of Denmark and Greenland: (a) compliance with applicable environmental laws and an approved independent environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) that includes climate, permafrost, ice, and marine considerations and documented Indigenous consultation; (b) proven, legally enforceable financing adequate for development, operations, closure, and remediation, including environmental bonds; (c) transparent corporate ownership and beneficial\u2011ownership disclosure; (d) technology\u2011transfer and intellectual\u2011property safeguards where appropriate to manage sensitive technologies; (e) security screening consistent with national security criteria set jointly by Denmark, Greenland, and NATO where applicable; and (f) a credible plan to meet local value creation targets.\n\nLocal Value Creation Targets & Implementation: Licensees shall commit to staged local value creation targets measured as the share of processing value\u2011added occurring in Greenland. The standard target shall be a minimum of 40% of processing value added generated in Greenland within five (5) years of commercial production start. Milestone targets for new projects are: 15% within 24 months, 30% within 36 months, and 40% within 60 months. License conditions shall include concrete investment plans, local hiring and training commitments, technology transfer plans consistent with safeguard provisions, and monitoring metrics. Where local processing is demonstrably infeasible due to technical or economic reasons, the licensing authority may approve an alternative value\u2011creation plan that provides commensurate benefits to Greenlandic communities (for example, shared ownership, revenue streams, or downstream investment commitments).\n\nOfftake, Financing & Strategic Competition Measures: Any single offtake contract that covers more than 25% of a licensed project\u2019s annual output shall require prior approval by the Danish licensing authority with Greenland\u2019s consent. Offtake approvals shall include assessment of buyer ownership, financing sources, export control compliance, and measures preventing forced technology transfer or transfer of sensitive processing capabilities without consent. State or state\u2011linked financing sources will be subject to enhanced review; where financing poses a demonstrable national security risk, Denmark may refuse approval or require mitigations, including escrow arrangements, divestment plans, or limits on offtake volumes.\n\nAudit Rights, Transparency & Indigenous Participation: Licensees must submit annual audited financial, environmental, and operations reports to Denmark and Greenland. Denmark and Greenland shall have on\u2011site inspection rights, including unannounced inspections, with arrangements to protect legitimate proprietary information. Indigenous representatives designated by Greenland shall have standing to observe environmental monitoring and community\u2011impact assessments; confidentiality protections for commercially sensitive material shall be limited and defined narrowly.\n\nCompliance, Remedies & Revenue Sharing: Material breaches of license conditions (including failure to meet environmental, security, financing, ownership, or local value commitments) shall trigger graduated remedies: corrective action plans with specified timelines, monetary fines scaled to impact and project revenue, suspension of operations, forfeiture of environmental bonds to address remediation, and ultimately revocation of license for persistent or severe breaches. License agreements shall include explicit revenue\u2011sharing provisions with Greenland, negotiated in good faith prior to license grant, which may include royalties, equity participation, local procurement quotas, training funds, and community development funds. The licensing authority will adopt clear penalty schedules and remediation timelines within 90 days of signature of this clause.\n\nEnforcement & Dispute Resolution: Enforcement actions shall be subject to administrative review within Denmark\u2019s licensing framework; applicants/operators shall have the right to appeal administrative decisions pursuant to defined procedures. For disputes between Denmark and Greenland concerning consent or interpretation of local\u2011value commitments, the parties shall seek resolution through a joint dispute\u2011resolution mechanism composed of senior officials from Denmark and Greenland and an independent technical panel. Unsettled commercial disputes shall be referred to binding international arbitration if provided for in the relevant license.\n\nSecurity Coordination & Information Sharing: License applicants must submit security risk assessments and agree to coordinated security oversight by Denmark with input from Greenland and, where necessary for alliance security, NATO. Security arrangements shall protect critical infrastructure while respecting civil liberties and Indigenous rights.\n\nEnvironmental, Social & Climate Safeguards: Licensing shall require an ESIA consistent with the shared environmental standards in the environmental clause, ongoing climate and ice\u2011condition monitoring, adaptive management measures, and financial assurances for closure and restoration. No license for new large\u2011scale processing facilities shall be granted without demonstrated plans for waste management that protect Arctic ecosystems.\n\nExceptions & Emergency Authorizations: In exceptional circumstances where immediate action is required to protect health, safety, or critical national interests, Denmark may grant a time\u2011limited emergency authorization not exceeding 180 days, subject to expedited environmental screening, automatic review at 90 days, and requirement to seek a full license for continued activity. Emergency authorizations will be narrow and temporary and do not waive the requirement for Greenlandic consultation.\n\nImplementation & Review: The licensing authority shall publish implementing regulations and penalty schedules within 90 calendar days of signature. The clause takes effect on signature; the full set of implementing regulations and review mechanisms must be in place within 12 months. The parties shall review the operation of this clause 18 months after signature and biennially thereafter.",

Denmark retains the authority to approve, condition, or deny access by U.S. or NATO forces.\n- Greenlandic government consultation and written consent: Denmark shall seek the prior consultation and written consent of the Government of Greenland for any proposed activity that is any of the following: (a) a temporary deployment in excess of 30 calendar days at a site; (b) a sustained activity expected to cumulatively exceed 90 calendar days in a calendar year at a site; (c) any proposal for permanent basing; (d) any activity that involves construction of new facilities, significant environmental modification, or long-term land use. Where Greenland\u2019s consent is required under this clause, Denmark shall not authorize the activity without the written consent of Greenland, except as provided in the Emergency Exception (Section 6).\n- Conditions: Denmark may attach reasonable conditions to approvals (including environmental, operational, and community safeguards). Conditions must be set out in writing and include timelines for compliance and monitoring requirements.\n\n3. Review of the 1951 Defense Framework and Related Legal Arrangements\n- Within 12 months of signature of this clause, Denmark and NATO shall complete a joint review of the application and implications of the 1951 defense framework (and associated instruments) as applied to Greenland. The review shall (a) identify areas requiring clarification or update with respect to basing, command relationships, legal jurisdiction, and approvals; (b) recommend necessary amendments or implementing arrangements; and (c) produce an agreed, public summary of findings and recommended next steps, subject to protection of legitimately classified details.\n- The review process shall formally consult with the Government of Greenland and allow Greenland to submit written positions. Any recommendations that change sovereign rights, permanent basing, or authority shall be submitted to NATO decision-making processes and to Denmark/Greenland for consent as required by Section 2.\n\n4. Notification, Submission Requirements, and Decision Timelines\n- Planned temporary access: For planned temporary access (deployments that will not exceed 180 calendar days at a site), the requesting U.S./NATO authority must submit a written notification to the Danish Ministry of Defence and the Government of Greenland at least 30 calendar days prior to mobilization. Notifications must include purpose, geographic coordinates or site description, scope, dates and duration, estimated personnel and major equipment types, sustained logistical needs, clearly identified environmental risks, a summary of mitigation measures, and contact information for the responsible operational and diplomatic authorities.\n- Short rotations: For short rotations (30 calendar days or less) notification must be provided at least 7 calendar days prior.\n- Denmark decision timeline: Within 21 calendar days of receipt of a materially complete notification, Denmark shall provide an initial written response of acceptance, conditional acceptance (with specified conditions), or denial. The response shall include any conditions, required mitigations, and compliance monitoring requirements.\n- Greenland response integration: Where Greenlandic consent is required under Section 2, Denmark shall incorporate Greenland\u2019s response into Denmark\u2019s decision within the 21\u2011day period whenever possible. If Greenland requests additional time to consider a materially complete request, Denmark shall permit up to 30 additional calendar days for Greenland to respond, except in cases of imminent threat or emergency.\n- Incomplete notifications: If Denmark determines a submission is materially incomplete, Denmark shall notify the requester within 7 calendar days specifying missing elements; the 21\u2011day decision clock pauses until the requester provides the missing material.\n\n5. Environmental Review, Indigenous Consultation, and Pre-conditions\n- Independent Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): No approval for permanent basing or any deployment or activity expected to exceed 30 calendar days at a site shall be granted unless an independent Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) that meets jointly agreed standards has been completed and made available to the Danish and Greenlandic authorities and affected communities. EIA scope shall include climate/ice impacts, permafrost, biodiversity, marine impacts, pollution risks, and cumulative effects.\n- Indigenous and community consultation: Documented consultation with affected Indigenous communities and local stakeholders is required prior to approvals for permanent basing, construction, sustained activities, or activities with potential significant environmental impacts. Consultation procedures shall be timely, transparent, culturally appropriate, and include meaningful opportunity to influence decisions and mitigation measures.\n- Financial assurances and mitigation: Approvals for activities requiring EIA must be accompanied by remediation and mitigation plans and financial assurances (e.g., bonds, escrowed funds, or insurance) sufficient to cover foreseeable environmental remediation, decontamination, restoration, and long-term monitoring obligations.\n\n6. Emergency and Hostile-Operations Exception\n- Immediate deployments: In the case of imminent hostile threats, urgent emergency operations necessary to protect life, safety, respond to natural disasters, or to repel an armed attack, U.S./NATO forces may deploy immediately to Greenlandic territory without prior written consent. Such emergency deployments must be narrowly tailored, time-limited, and strictly proportionate to the emergency at hand.\n- Notification: The deploying authority shall provide immediate oral notification to the Danish Ministry of Defence and the Government of Greenland within 4 hours of deployment commencement and a complete written notification within 72 hours describing the nature, purpose, scope, location, estimated duration, and environmental risks of the deployment.\n- Retrospective approval and remedial process: Retrospective written approval shall be sought from Denmark and Greenland within 72 hours of the written notification. If Denmark and/or Greenland withhold retrospective approval, the parties shall immediately convene an expedited joint meeting (see Section 8) to agree on remedial measures, including withdrawal, modification of operations, or remediation of harm. Emergency authorizations shall automatically terminate when the emergency ends or after a time period jointly determined in writing, whichever is sooner.\n\n7. De-confliction, Hotline, Incident Reporting, and Fact-Finding\n- Hotline and secure channel: A 24/7 diplomatic\u2011military hotline and secure communications channel shall be established and maintained among the Danish Ministry of Defence, the Government of Greenland (designated crisis contact), and NATO's designated regional command. The hotline shall be operational no later than 6 months after signature of this clause and be tested quarterly thereafter.\n- Immediate incident reporting: All incidents involving injury to persons, significant environmental harm, damage to property, or events that create a material risk of escalation between military forces shall be reported to the hotline within 2 hours of awareness.\n- Joint fact-finding and remedial timeline: For reported incidents, the parties shall initiate a joint fact-finding process within 48 hours and use best-efforts to complete a preliminary joint factual report within 7 calendar days. The parties shall also agree on immediate de\u2011escalation and remedial measures within 7 days.\n\n8. Oversight, Inspections, Status of Forces, and Legal Jurisdiction\n- Inspections: Denmark retains the right to conduct annual inspections of facilities and activities associated with U.S./NATO presence. Greenlandic representatives shall be afforded the opportunity to participate in inspections that directly affect their jurisdiction, communities, or environmental interests. Inspection plans and scopes shall be shared at least 14 days in advance except in urgent circumstances.\n- Classified and operational-security protected inspections: Inspection protocols shall protect legitimate operational security. Procedures and personnel clearances for classified or sensitive inspections shall be agreed within 6 months of signature.\n- SOFA: NATO and the United States shall table a draft Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) or implementing arrangement addressing criminal and civil jurisdiction, claims, environmental liability, and administrative procedures within 6 months of signature. Pending conclusion of a SOFA, NATO personnel remain subject to Danish criminal and civil law, consistent with the exercise of functional immunities under existing international law.\n\n9. Compliance, Enforcement, and Dispute Resolution\n- Immediate suspension: Material violations of this clause or of specific conditions attached to access shall result in immediate suspension of the relevant activity or access pending review; Denmark shall notify NATO and the United States in writing of any suspension.\n- Trilateral review: A trilateral review comprising representatives of Denmark, Greenland, and NATO/United States shall be convened within 30 calendar days of suspension to assess the violation and agree remedial measures. The parties shall use best-efforts to agree remedial action within 60 calendar days. Interim measures to limit harm shall be implemented immediately while the review proceeds.\n- Arbitration: If remedial action is not agreed within 60 calendar days, the matter shall be referred to an expedited arbitration panel composed of one appointee each from Denmark, Greenland, and NATO (to be selected within 15 calendar days of referral). The panel shall determine remedies and issue a written decision within 90 calendar days of its selection. The panel\u2019s decision shall be binding on operational access and implementation measures pending lawful review but shall not be construed to modify sovereign rights of Denmark or Greenland absent their written consent.\n- Remedies and enforcement: Remedies may include specified corrective actions, suspension or revocation of access privileges, financial liability for damages, and requirements for monitoring and verification. Implementation of remedies shall be overseen by a joint compliance group established under this clause.\n\n10. Transparency and Reporting\n- Annual consolidated report: NATO and Denmark shall publish an annual consolidated report summarizing numbers, types, locations, and durations of U.S./NATO activities and presences in Greenland, subject to protection of legitimately classified information. The report shall include a summary of incidents, inspections conducted, suspensions, remedial actions taken, outcomes of fact-finding investigations, and status of any outstanding disputes.\n- Confidential briefings: Where necessary for security, confidential briefings and classified annexes may be provided to appropriate Greenlandic authorities under agreed procedures.\n\n11. Implementation, Capacity-Building, and Review\n- Effective date: This clause is effective on signature.\n- Implementation timeline: Draft SOFA provisions, inspection protocols, hotline implementation plan, and rules of procedure for trilateral reviews and arbitration shall be completed within 6 months of signature. The 1951 framework review required under Section 3 shall be completed within 12 months of signature.\n- Capacity and training: NATO and the United States shall provide reasonable capacity-building, training, and technical assistance to Greenlandic authorities to support consultations, environmental review participation, and incident response, as mutually agreed.\n- Reviews thereafter: The parties shall conduct a comprehensive review of implementation 12 months after signature and thereafter at least once every two years, or sooner by mutual agreement.\n\n12. Exceptions and Savings Clauses\n- Nothing in this clause shall derogate from Denmark\u2019s sovereign rights over Greenland. This clause does not prejudice other treaty obligations among the parties but provides the procedural requirements for access and basing described above.\n- In a declared state of general armed conflict involving NATO or an ally where alliance-wide decision-making requires different measures, the parties shall consult promptly to adapt procedures consistent with obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty and with respect for Danish sovereignty and Greenlandic consultation rights where practicable.\n\n13. Definitions for Implementation\n- Parties shall agree jointly on a short glossary of technical terms used in notifications and EIAs within 60 days of signature to avoid disputes about completeness of submissions.\n\nThis replacement clause supersedes Clause C17 and is intended to be implemented consistent with the other clauses in this instrument and with applicable domestic and international law.",

        "text": "Replacement Clause C15 (supersedes C15): Critical Minerals Licensing, Local Value, and Strategic Safeguards\n\nScope & Authority:\n- This clause governs licensing, exploration, extraction, processing, and offtake of critical and strategic minerals in Greenland (\"projects\"). Licensing decisions shall be led by the Government of Greenland in accordance with the constitutional authority of the Kingdom of Denmark and applicable Greenlandic and Danish law. Where national-security, foreign-policy, or defence implications arise, the Government of Denmark shall exercise the oversight provided under Kingdom arrangements; NATO shall be notified where projects materially affect Alliance infrastructure, basing, or agreed defence access arrangements.\n\nDefinitions:\n- \"Materially complete application\" means an application that contains all mandatory items listed under Licensing Criteria (below) as determined within 15 business days of receipt by the licensing authority.\n- \"Identified strategic competitor\" means any state or entity designated by the Government of Greenland in coordination with the Government of Denmark under a public list reviewed at least annually.\n\nLicensing Criteria & Pre-Decision Timelines:\n- Required submission materials: ownership and beneficial\u2011ownership disclosure; security\u2011screening documentation per Kingdom of Denmark procedures; proof of financing (binding term sheet or equivalent); Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) initiation evidence and summary baseline report; a binding local\u2011value creation plan; proposed mine and processing plans; offtake term sheet(s) if pre-arranged; community engagement record; and health, safety, and emergency-response plans.\n- The licensing authority shall acknowledge receipt and advise within 15 business days whether the application is materially complete or specify outstanding items. Applicants may remedy deficiencies within a single 30\u2011day cure period.\n- Licensing decision timeline: the licensing authority shall make and publish a written decision granting, granting with conditions, or denying the license within 120 calendar days from receipt of the materially complete application. This period may be extended by a single mutual written agreement not to exceed 60 calendar days for complex multi\u2011jurisdictional matters or where significant new information is provided by the applicant.\n\nLocal Value Creation Requirements and Targets:\n- Licensees must submit a binding Local Value Plan (LVP) as part of the application. The LVP must set phased targets for Greenland processing, refining, value\u2011added activities, employment, training, technology transfer, and procurement of local goods and services. The LVP shall identify measurable KPIs and a five\u2011year implementation schedule linked to production milestones.\n- Minimum target: licensees shall commit to achieving at least 35% of processing value\u2011added activity in Greenland within five (5) years of commencement of commercial production, unless otherwise modified in the licence with documented, objective justification and remediation measures. Specific targets beyond the five\u2011year baseline shall be set in individual licences and may include staged increases, local employment quotas, and supply\u2011chain localisation milestones.\n- Licensees failing materially to meet LVP KPIs shall be subject to corrective action plans, increased monitoring, financial penalties, and, for persistent failure, staged enforcement measures up to suspension or revocation.\n\nFinancing, Offtake, and Technology Safeguards:\n- Offtake agreements that cover more than 25% of the licensee\u2019s forecast annual production require prior written approval by the licensing authority. Approval shall be granted or denied within 45 calendar days of a materially complete offtake submission and may be conditioned on: (a) safeguards for technology and processing know\u2011how; (b) demonstrated measures preventing diversion of material to sanctioned or designated entities; and (c) provisions ensuring fulfilment of local\u2011value commitments.\n- Technology\u2011safeguard provisions shall include requirements for licensing or restriction of transfer of processing technology, intellectual\u2011property controls, and where appropriate, escrow arrangements for critical processing inputs or know\u2011how.\n- All material financing sources must be disclosed and are subject to the Enhanced Screening provisions below.\n\nEnhanced Screening and Mitigation for State\u2011Linked or Strategic Competitor Interests:\n- Projects financed, controlled, or materially influenced (by equity, debt, offtake, or other economic dependence) by state\u2011owned enterprises, state\u2011influenced entities, or entities from an Identified Strategic Competitor list shall be subject to enhanced review.\n- Enhanced review process: within 30 calendar days of a determination that enhanced review is applicable, the licensing authority shall provide the applicant a written list of specific national\u2011security, economic-security, and supply\u2011chain risks requiring mitigation. The applicant shall propose a Mitigation and Governance Plan within 60 calendar days. The licensing authority shall conclude enhanced review and issue a decision within 90 calendar days after receiving a materially complete Mitigation and Governance Plan.\n- Mitigation measures may include increased local ownership requirements, joint\u2011venture structures with Greenlandic partners, export and offtake controls, on\u2011site monitoring by designated authorities, technology access limitations, performance bonds, reduced royalty payments escrowed pending compliance, and, where mitigation is insufficient, rejection of the application.\n\nAudit Rights, Transparency, and Reporting:\n- Licensees shall deliver annual audited financial statements and compliance reports, within 90 days of fiscal year-end, to the licensing authority and to the Government of Denmark for matters within its oversight remit. Reports shall include production volumes, offtake counterparties, royalties and payments, and fulfilment of LVP KPIs (disaggregated by activity and location).\n- The licensing authority and the Government of Denmark shall have the right to conduct on\u2011site inspections and audits, with at least 72 hours\u2019 notice for routine inspections; shorter notice is permitted for exigent circumstances including safety, health, or security incidents. Confidential business information may be redacted for publication but shall be available to oversight authorities and, where relevant, to NATO under agreed confidentiality arrangements when defence implications exist.\n\nCompliance, Enforcement, Remedies, and Financial Safeguards:\n- Breaches of material licence conditions, including wilful misrepresentation, failure to meet agreed LVP KPIs without approved remediation, breach of offtake approval conditions, or material national\u2011security concerns, may result in administrative fines (set according to Greenlandic regulatory schedules), corrective orders, suspension of operations, revocation of licenses, escrow or forfeiture of royalties, and forfeiture of performance bonds.\n- Prior to grant of any licence, licensees shall establish a performance bond or other financial security instrument sufficient to guarantee reclamation, environmental remediation, payment of potential fines, and fulfilment of critical supply obligations; the licensing authority shall set the amount based on project scale and environmental risk.\n\nRevenue\u2011Sharing, Royalties, and Escrow Mechanisms:\n- Revenue\u2011sharing frameworks (including royalty rates and mechanisms for profit sharing with Greenland) shall be negotiated and, wherever possible, finalized within 180 calendar days of grant of licence. Absent finalized terms within 180 days, a default escrow mechanism shall apply whereby a minimum percentage of royalties (to be specified in the licence) is held in escrow pending final agreement; escrow funds shall be released or adjusted once negotiations conclude.\n\nCoordination with Defence, NATO, and Emergency Exceptions:\n- Where a project may materially affect defence access, basing arrangements, NATO infrastructure, or de\u2011escalation/notification protocols, the licensing authority must notify the Government of Denmark and NATO within seven (7) calendar days of determining the matter is material. The authority may impose additional security conditions, temporary restrictions on particular offtakes, or require immediate mitigation measures in consultation with Denmark and NATO.\n- In declared national emergency or urgent defence circumstances, the Government of Denmark, in consultation with Greenlandic authorities, may institute temporary measures that supersede certain licence conditions to secure defence or Alliance interests; such measures shall be proportionate, time\u2011limited, and accompanied by a plan to restore standard licensing arrangements.\n\nAppeal, Review, and Dispute Resolution:\n- Applicants and licensees shall have the right to an administrative appeal within 30 calendar days of a licensing decision per Greenlandic administrative law, and judicial review thereafter in Greenlandic courts. Licence terms may include mandatory arbitration clauses for commercial disputes consistent with domestic law but may not restrict judicial review of administrative licensing actions.\n\nTransitional and Implementation Provisions:\n- Existing licences in force at the time of adoption of this clause shall be reviewed against the Local Value Plan requirements at the time of the next licence renewal or within two (2) years, whichever occurs first. Any new incremental licence conditions imposed pursuant to this clause shall be proportionate and include a reasonable compliance timeline.\n\nExceptions and Confidentiality:\n- Confidential business information may be protected from public disclosure to the extent permitted by Greenlandic law; however, nondisclosure does not limit the obligation to provide full information to oversight authorities, the Government of Denmark, or NATO where defence or security implications exist.\n\nImplementation and Guidance:\n- The licensing authority, in coordination with the Government of Denmark, shall publish implementing regulations and procedural guidance within 90 calendar days of adoption of this clause to specify forms, timelines, fees, and template LVP/KPI requirements.\n\nReview Cycle:\n- The Governments of Greenland and Denmark shall jointly review the effectiveness of this clause and its implementing guidance no later than 24 months after adoption and periodically thereafter every three years, taking into account market conditions, technological developments, environmental safeguards, and Alliance security considerations.",

Denmark shall seek the prior consultation and written consent of the Government of Greenland for any access, temporary deployment in excess of 30 days, sustained activities expected to cumulatively exceed 90 days in a calendar year, or any proposal for permanent basing. No access or basing that involves construction of new facilities, significant environmental modification, or long-term land use shall commence without Greenlandic consent.\n\nReview of Framework: Within 12 months of signature, Denmark and NATO shall complete a joint review of the 1951 defense framework as it applies to Greenland and produce an agreed, public summary of any proposed updates to basing, command relationships, and legal arrangements. Proposed changes to the 1951 framework will be submitted for consultation with the Government of Greenland and presented to NATO for decision-making consistent with alliance processes.\n\nNotification & Approval Timelines: For planned temporary access (deployments that will not exceed 180 days per site), the requesting NATO/United States authority shall provide written notification to the Danish Ministry of Defence and the Government of Greenland at least 30 calendar days prior to mobilization, including purpose, scope, duration, force composition, and environmental risk assessment. For short rotations (30 days or less) notification shall be provided at least 7 calendar days prior. Denmark will render an initial acceptance/conditional acceptance/denial in writing within 21 calendar days of receiving a materially complete notification. Requests that require Greenlandic consent shall have Greenland\u2019s response incorporated within Denmark\u2019s decision in the same 21\u2011day period whenever possible; if Greenland requests additional time, Denmark will allow up to 30 additional days, except in emergencies.\n\nEmergency & Hostile Operations Exception: In the case of imminent hostile threats or urgent emergency operations necessary to protect life, safety, or to respond to external attack, NATO/U.S. forces may deploy immediately. In such cases the deploying authority shall provide immediate oral notification (within 4 hours) and a complete written notification within 72 hours to Denmark and Greenland. Retrospective approval shall be sought within 72 hours; if Denmark/Greenland withhold retrospective approval, the deploying force shall take immediate remedial actions agreed in an expedited joint meeting (see Compliance & Enforcement). Any emergency deployment authorizations will be narrowly tailored and time limited to the duration of the emergency as determined jointly.\n\nDe\u2011confliction, Hotline & Incident Protocols: A 24/7 diplomatic\u2011military hotline and secure communication channel shall be established and maintained among the Danish Ministry of Defence, the Government of Greenland (designated crisis contact), and NATO's designated regional command to support planning, de\u2011confliction, and immediate incident reporting.

Greenlandic representatives shall be afforded the opportunity to participate in inspections affecting their jurisdiction or communities. NATO personnel operating in Greenland shall remain subject to Danish criminal and civil law unless otherwise agreed in a separate Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA); a draft SOFA shall be tabled within 6 months of signature. Inspection protocols shall protect operational security while ensuring meaningful oversight; procedures for classified inspections shall be agreed in advance.\n\nCompliance, Enforcement & Dispute Resolution: Violations of this clause or conditions attached to access shall trigger immediate suspension of the relevant activity or access pending a joint review. Denmark shall notify NATO and the United States in writing of any suspension; a trilateral review (Denmark, Greenland, NATO/United States) shall be convened within 30 days to assess the violation and agree remedial measures. Where remedial action is not agreed within 60 days, the suspension shall continue until resolution. For unresolved disputes, the parties will refer the matter to an expedited arbitration panel composed of one appointee each from Denmark, Greenland, and NATO (selected within 15 days of referral) whose decision shall be issued within 90 days and be binding on operational access while preserving sovereign rights.\n\nEnvironmental & Indigenous Safeguards: No approval for permanent basing or deployments exceeding 30 days shall be granted without an independent environmental impact assessment (EIA) adhering to agreed standards (see Clause on Environmental Safeguards) and documented consultation with affected Indigenous communities. Remediation and mitigation plans, and financial assurances to cover environmental harm and site restoration, must be in place prior to commencement of works.\n\nTransparency & Reporting: NATO and Denmark shall publish an annual consolidated report summarizing numbers, types, and durations of U.S./NATO activities in Greenland, subject to protection of legitimately classified information.

Where additional information is requested, the 90\u2011day clock pauses until a complete submission; final decisions shall be made within 180 calendar days of a complete submission. Existing permits and projects in active production at the time of signature shall be reviewed under these standards within 12 months and operators shall present compliance transition plans within 6 months.\n\nLicensing Criteria & Conditions: Licenses shall be granted only where the applicant demonstrates, to the satisfaction of Denmark and Greenland: (a) compliance with applicable environmental laws and an approved independent environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) that includes climate, permafrost, ice, and marine considerations and documented Indigenous consultation; (b) proven, legally enforceable financing adequate for development, operations, closure, and remediation, including environmental bonds; (c) transparent corporate ownership and beneficial\u2011ownership disclosure; (d) technology\u2011transfer and intellectual\u2011property safeguards where appropriate to manage sensitive technologies; (e) security screening consistent with national security criteria set jointly by Denmark, Greenland, and NATO where applicable; and (f) a credible plan to meet local value creation targets.\n\nLocal Value Creation Targets & Implementation: Licensees shall commit to staged local value creation targets measured as the share of processing value\u2011added occurring in Greenland. The standard target shall be a minimum of 40% of processing value added generated in Greenland within five (5) years of commercial production start. Milestone targets for new projects are: 15% within 24 months, 30% within 36 months, and 40% within 60 months. License conditions shall include concrete investment plans, local hiring and training commitments, technology transfer plans consistent with safeguard provisions, and monitoring metrics. Where local processing is demonstrably infeasible due to technical or economic reasons, the licensing authority may approve an alternative value\u2011creation plan that provides commensurate benefits to Greenlandic communities (for example, shared ownership, revenue streams, or downstream investment commitments).\n\nOfftake, Financing & Strategic Competition Measures: Any single offtake contract that covers more than 25% of a licensed project\u2019s annual output shall require prior approval by the Danish licensing authority with Greenland\u2019s consent. Offtake approvals shall include assessment of buyer ownership, financing sources, export control compliance, and measures preventing forced technology transfer or transfer of sensitive processing capabilities without consent. State or state\u2011linked financing sources will be subject to enhanced review; where financing poses a demonstrable national security risk, Denmark may refuse approval or require mitigations, including escrow arrangements, divestment plans, or limits on offtake volumes.\n\nAudit Rights, Transparency & Indigenous Participation: Licensees must submit annual audited financial, environmental, and operations reports to Denmark and Greenland. Denmark and Greenland shall have on\u2011site inspection rights, including unannounced inspections, with arrangements to protect legitimate proprietary information. Indigenous representatives designated by Greenland shall have standing to observe environmental monitoring and community\u2011impact assessments; confidentiality protections for commercially sensitive material shall be limited and defined narrowly.\n\nCompliance, Remedies & Revenue Sharing: Material breaches of license conditions (including failure to meet environmental, security, financing, ownership, or local value commitments) shall trigger graduated remedies: corrective action plans with specified timelines, monetary fines scaled to impact and project revenue, suspension of operations, forfeiture of environmental bonds to address remediation, and ultimately revocation of license for persistent or severe breaches. License agreements shall include explicit revenue\u2011sharing provisions with Greenland, negotiated in good faith prior to license grant, which may include royalties, equity participation, local procurement quotas, training funds, and community development funds. The licensing authority will adopt clear penalty schedules and remediation timelines within 90 days of signature of this clause.\n\nEnforcement & Dispute Resolution: Enforcement actions shall be subject to administrative review within Denmark\u2019s licensing framework; applicants/operators shall have the right to appeal administrative decisions pursuant to defined procedures. For disputes between Denmark and Greenland concerning consent or interpretation of local\u2011value commitments, the parties shall seek resolution through a joint dispute\u2011resolution mechanism composed of senior officials from Denmark and Greenland and an independent technical panel. Unsettled commercial disputes shall be referred to binding international arbitration if provided for in the relevant license.\n\nSecurity Coordination & Information Sharing: License applicants must submit security risk assessments and agree to coordinated security oversight by Denmark with input from Greenland and, where necessary for alliance security, NATO. Security arrangements shall protect critical infrastructure while respecting civil liberties and Indigenous rights.\n\nEnvironmental, Social & Climate Safeguards: Licensing shall require an ESIA consistent with the shared environmental standards in the environmental clause, ongoing climate and ice\u2011condition monitoring, adaptive management measures, and financial assurances for closure and restoration. No license for new large\u2011scale processing facilities shall be granted without demonstrated plans for waste management that protect Arctic ecosystems.\n\nExceptions & Emergency Authorizations: In exceptional circumstances where immediate action is required to protect health, safety, or critical national interests, Denmark may grant a time\u2011limited emergency authorization not exceeding 180 days, subject to expedited environmental screening, automatic review at 90 days, and requirement to seek a full license for continued activity. Emergency authorizations will be narrow and temporary and do not waive the requirement for Greenlandic consultation.\n\nImplementation & Review: The licensing authority shall publish implementing regulations and penalty schedules within 90 calendar days of signature. The clause takes effect on signature; the full set of implementing regulations and review mechanisms must be in place within 12 months. The parties shall review the operation of this clause 18 months after signature and biennially thereafter.",

Activities on Greenlandic\u2011administered lands or those likely to cumulatively exceed 30 days require prior consultation and documented consent from the Government of Greenland. No construction or long\u2011term land use shall commence without Greenlandic consent.\n\nNotification & Timelines: For planned temporary access, the requester shall provide written notification at least 30 calendar days prior; short rotations (<=30 days) require 7 calendar days' notice. Denmark will render an initial written decision (accept/conditional accept/deny) within 21 calendar days of a materially complete notification. Where Greenland consent is required, Denmark will incorporate Greenland\u2019s response within the 21\u2011day window or allow up to 30 additional days if Greenland requests them.\n\nEmergency Exceptions: In imminent hostile threats or urgent emergencies, forces may deploy immediately with oral notification within 4 hours and full written notification within 72 hours. Retrospective written approval must be sought within 72 hours; if withheld, deploying forces shall cease non\u2011essential activities and engage in expedited remedial action.\n\nDeconfliction & Incident Protocols: Establish a 24/7 secure diplomatic\u2011military hotline linking Danish, Greenlandic, U.S., and NATO regional command.

          "text": "Clause 1 \u2014 Defense Access, Basing, Notification, and De\u2011escalation Protocols (Greenland) (Replacement for C17)\n\n1. Scope and Definitions\n- Scope: This clause governs all United States and NATO military access, temporary deployments, rotations, training activities, sustainment operations, logistical use, and basing arrangements within the territory of Greenland, including use of airfields, ports, ranges, and temporary sites. Civil-military activities that directly enable the foregoing (e.g., major infrastructure work, fuel caches, forward logistics nodes) are included.\n- Definitions: \"Temporary access\" means presence or activity at a given site that does not exceed 180 calendar days in any single calendar year at that site. \"Short rotation\" means a deployment or rotation of forces 30 calendar days or less. \"Sustained activity\" means cumulative activity at a site expected to exceed 90 calendar days in a calendar year. \"Permanent basing\" means a continuous presence or facility at a site that exceeds 180 calendar days in a calendar year, or which is explicitly established as permanent under a bilateral or multilateral instrument. \"Construction\" or \"significant environmental modification\" includes projects that alter land use, shorelines, groundwater, permafrost, or require heavy earthmoving or consolidated footings.\n\n2. Authority, Consent, and Local Consultation\n- Sovereignty and ultimate authority over access, basing, and land-use decisions in Greenland rests with the Kingdom of Denmark. Denmark retains the authority to approve, condition, or deny access by U.S. or NATO forces.\n- Greenlandic government consultation and written consent: Denmark shall seek the prior consultation and written consent of the Government of Greenland for any proposed activity that is any of the following: (a) a temporary deployment in excess of 30 calendar days at a site; (b) a sustained activity expected to cumulatively exceed 90 calendar days in a calendar year at a site; (c) any proposal for permanent basing; (d) any activity that involves construction of new facilities, significant environmental modification, or long-term land use. Where Greenland\u2019s consent is required under this clause, Denmark shall not authorize the activity without the written consent of Greenland, except as provided in the Emergency Exception (Section 6).\n- Conditions: Denmark may attach reasonable conditions to approvals (including environmental, operational, and community safeguards). Conditions must be set out in writing and include timelines for compliance and monitoring requirements.\n\n3. Review of the 1951 Defense Framework and Related Legal Arrangements\n- Within 12 months of signature of this clause, Denmark and NATO shall complete a joint review of the application and implications of the 1951 defense framework (and associated instruments) as applied to Greenland. The review shall (a) identify areas requiring clarification or update with respect to basing, command relationships, legal jurisdiction, and approvals; (b) recommend necessary amendments or implementing arrangements; and (c) produce an agreed, public summary of findings and recommended next steps, subject to protection of legitimately classified details.\n- The review process shall formally consult with the Government of Greenland and allow Greenland to submit written positions. Any recommendations that change sovereign rights, permanent basing, or authority shall be submitted to NATO decision-making processes and to Denmark/Greenland for consent as required by Section 2.\n\n4. Notification, Submission Requirements, and Decision Timelines\n- Planned temporary access: For planned temporary access (deployments that will not exceed 180 calendar days at a site), the requesting U.S./NATO authority must submit a written notification to the Danish Ministry of Defence and the Government of Greenland at least 30 calendar days prior to mobilization. Notifications must include purpose, geographic coordinates or site description, scope, dates and duration, estimated personnel and major equipment types, sustained logistical needs, clearly identified environmental risks, a summary of mitigation measures, and contact information for the responsible operational and diplomatic authorities.\n- Short rotations: For short rotations (30 calendar days or less) notification must be provided at least 7 calendar days prior.\n- Denmark decision timeline: Within 21 calendar days of receipt of a materially complete notification, Denmark shall provide an initial written response of acceptance, conditional acceptance (with specified conditions), or denial. The response shall include any conditions, required mitigations, and compliance monitoring requirements.\n- Greenland response integration: Where Greenlandic consent is required under Section 2, Denmark shall incorporate Greenland\u2019s response into Denmark\u2019s decision within the 21\u2011day period whenever possible. If Greenland requests additional time to consider a materially complete request, Denmark shall permit up to 30 additional calendar days for Greenland to respond, except in cases of imminent threat or emergency.\n- Incomplete notifications: If Denmark determines a submission is materially incomplete, Denmark shall notify the requester within 7 calendar days specifying missing elements; the 21\u2011day decision clock pauses until the requester provides the missing material.\n\n5. Environmental Review, Indigenous Consultation, and Pre-conditions\n- Independent Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): No approval for permanent basing or any deployment or activity expected to exceed 30 calendar days at a site shall be granted unless an independent Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) that meets jointly agreed standards has been completed and made available to the Danish and Greenlandic authorities and affected communities. EIA scope shall include climate/ice impacts, permafrost, biodiversity, marine impacts, pollution risks, and cumulative effects.\n- Indigenous and community consultation: Documented consultation with affected Indigenous communities and local stakeholders is required prior to approvals for permanent basing, construction, sustained activities, or activities with potential significant environmental impacts. Consultation procedures shall be timely, transparent, culturally appropriate, and include meaningful opportunity to influence decisions and mitigation measures.\n- Financial assurances and mitigation: Approvals for activities requiring EIA must be accompanied by remediation and mitigation plans and financial assurances (e.g., bonds, escrowed funds, or insurance) sufficient to cover foreseeable environmental remediation, decontamination, restoration, and long-term monitoring obligations.\n\n6. Emergency and Hostile-Operations Exception\n- Immediate deployments: In the case of imminent hostile threats, urgent emergency operations necessary to protect life, safety, respond to natural disasters, or to repel an armed attack, U.S./NATO forces may deploy immediately to Greenlandic territory without prior written consent. Such emergency deployments must be narrowly tailored, time-limited, and strictly proportionate to the emergency at hand.\n- Notification: The deploying authority shall provide immediate oral notification to the Danish Ministry of Defence and the Government of Greenland within 4 hours of deployment commencement and a complete written notification within 72 hours describing the nature, purpose, scope, location, estimated duration, and environmental risks of the deployment.\n- Retrospective approval and remedial process: Retrospective written approval shall be sought from Denmark and Greenland within 72 hours of the written notification. If Denmark and/or Greenland withhold retrospective approval, the parties shall immediately convene an expedited joint meeting (see Section 8) to agree on remedial measures, including withdrawal, modification of operations, or remediation of harm. Emergency authorizations shall automatically terminate when the emergency ends or after a time period jointly determined in writing, whichever is sooner.\n\n7. De-confliction, Hotline, Incident Reporting, and Fact-Finding\n- Hotline and secure channel: A 24/7 diplomatic\u2011military hotline and secure communications channel shall be established and maintained among the Danish Ministry of Defence, the Government of Greenland (designated crisis contact), and NATO's designated regional command. The hotline shall be operational no later than 6 months after signature of this clause and be tested quarterly thereafter.\n- Immediate incident reporting: All incidents involving injury to persons, significant environmental harm, damage to property, or events that create a material risk of escalation between military forces shall be reported to the hotline within 2 hours of awareness.\n- Joint fact-finding and remedial timeline: For reported incidents, the parties shall initiate a joint fact-finding process within 48 hours and use best-efforts to complete a preliminary joint factual report within 7 calendar days. The parties shall also agree on immediate de\u2011escalation and remedial measures within 7 days.\n\n8. Oversight, Inspections, Status of Forces, and Legal Jurisdiction\n- Inspections: Denmark retains the right to conduct annual inspections of facilities and activities associated with U.S./NATO presence. Greenlandic representatives shall be afforded the opportunity to participate in inspections that directly affect their jurisdiction, communities, or environmental interests. Inspection plans and scopes shall be shared at least 14 days in advance except in urgent circumstances.\n- Classified and operational-security protected inspections: Inspection protocols shall protect legitimate operational security. Procedures and personnel clearances for classified or sensitive inspections shall be agreed within 6 months of signature.\n- SOFA: NATO and the United States shall table a draft Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) or implementing arrangement addressing criminal and civil jurisdiction, claims, environmental liability, and administrative procedures within 6 months of signature. Pending conclusion of a SOFA, NATO personnel remain subject to Danish criminal and civil law, consistent with the exercise of functional immunities under existing international law.\n\n9. Compliance, Enforcement, and Dispute Resolution\n- Immediate suspension: Material violations of this clause or of specific conditions attached to access shall result in immediate suspension of the relevant activity or access pending review; Denmark shall notify NATO and the United States in writing of any suspension.\n- Trilateral review: A trilateral review comprising representatives of Denmark, Greenland, and NATO/United States shall be convened within 30 calendar days of suspension to assess the violation and agree remedial measures. The parties shall use best-efforts to agree remedial action within 60 calendar days. Interim measures to limit harm shall be implemented immediately while the review proceeds.\n- Arbitration: If remedial action is not agreed within 60 calendar days, the matter shall be referred to an expedited arbitration panel composed of one appointee each from Denmark, Greenland, and NATO (to be selected within 15 calendar days of referral). The panel shall determine remedies and issue a written decision within 90 calendar days of its selection. The panel\u2019s decision shall be binding on operational access and implementation measures pending lawful review but shall not be construed to modify sovereign rights of Denmark or Greenland absent their written consent.\n- Remedies and enforcement: Remedies may include specified corrective actions, suspension or revocation of access privileges, financial liability for damages, and requirements for monitoring and verification. Implementation of remedies shall be overseen by a joint compliance group established under this clause.\n\n10. Transparency and Reporting\n- Annual consolidated report: NATO and Denmark shall publish an annual consolidated report summarizing numbers, types, locations, and durations of U.S./NATO activities and presences in Greenland, subject to protection of legitimately classified information. The report shall include a summary of incidents, inspections conducted, suspensions, remedial actions taken, outcomes of fact-finding investigations, and status of any outstanding disputes.\n- Confidential briefings: Where necessary for security, confidential briefings and classified annexes may be provided to appropriate Greenlandic authorities under agreed procedures.\n\n11. Implementation, Capacity-Building, and Review\n- Effective date: This clause is effective on signature.\n- Implementation timeline: Draft SOFA provisions, inspection protocols, hotline implementation plan, and rules of procedure for trilateral reviews and arbitration shall be completed within 6 months of signature. The 1951 framework review required under Section 3 shall be completed within 12 months of signature.\n- Capacity and training: NATO and the United States shall provide reasonable capacity-building, training, and technical assistance to Greenlandic authorities to support consultations, environmental review participation, and incident response, as mutually agreed.\n- Reviews thereafter: The parties shall conduct a comprehensive review of implementation 12 months after signature and thereafter at least once every two years, or sooner by mutual agreement.\n\n12. Exceptions and Savings Clauses\n- Nothing in this clause shall derogate from Denmark\u2019s sovereign rights over Greenland. This clause does not prejudice other treaty obligations among the parties but provides the procedural requirements for access and basing described above.\n- In a declared state of general armed conflict involving NATO or an ally where alliance-wide decision-making requires different measures, the parties shall consult promptly to adapt procedures consistent with obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty and with respect for Danish sovereignty and Greenlandic consultation rights where practicable.\n\n13. Definitions for Implementation\n- Parties shall agree jointly on a short glossary of technical terms used in notifications and EIAs within 60 days of signature to avoid disputes about completeness of submissions.\n\nThis replacement clause supersedes Clause C17 and is intended to be implemented consistent with the other clauses in this instrument and with applicable domestic and international law.",

          "text": "Replacement Clause C15 (supersedes C15): Critical Minerals Licensing, Local Value, and Strategic Safeguards\n\nScope & Authority:\n- This clause governs licensing, exploration, extraction, processing, and offtake of critical and strategic minerals in Greenland (\"projects\"). Licensing decisions shall be led by the Government of Greenland in accordance with the constitutional authority of the Kingdom of Denmark and applicable Greenlandic and Danish law. Where national-security, foreign-policy, or defence implications arise, the Government of Denmark shall exercise the oversight provided under Kingdom arrangements; NATO shall be notified where projects materially affect Alliance infrastructure, basing, or agreed defence access arrangements.\n\nDefinitions:\n- \"Materially complete application\" means an application that contains all mandatory items listed under Licensing Criteria (below) as determined within 15 business days of receipt by the licensing authority.\n- \"Identified strategic competitor\" means any state or entity designated by the Government of Greenland in coordination with the Government of Denmark under a public list reviewed at least annually.\n\nLicensing Criteria & Pre-Decision Timelines:\n- Required submission materials: ownership and beneficial\u2011ownership disclosure; security\u2011screening documentation per Kingdom of Denmark procedures; proof of financing (binding term sheet or equivalent); Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) initiation evidence and summary baseline report; a binding local\u2011value creation plan; proposed mine and processing plans; offtake term sheet(s) if pre-arranged; community engagement record; and health, safety, and emergency-response plans.\n- The licensing authority shall acknowledge receipt and advise within 15 business days whether the application is materially complete or specify outstanding items. Applicants may remedy deficiencies within a single 30\u2011day cure period.\n- Licensing decision timeline: the licensing authority shall make and publish a written decision granting, granting with conditions, or denying the license within 120 calendar days from receipt of the materially complete application. This period may be extended by a single mutual written agreement not to exceed 60 calendar days for complex multi\u2011jurisdictional matters or where significant new information is provided by the applicant.\n\nLocal Value Creation Requirements and Targets:\n- Licensees must submit a binding Local Value Plan (LVP) as part of the application. The LVP must set phased targets for Greenland processing, refining, value\u2011added activities, employment, training, technology transfer, and procurement of local goods and services. The LVP shall identify measurable KPIs and a five\u2011year implementation schedule linked to production milestones.\n- Minimum target: licensees shall commit to achieving at least 35% of processing value\u2011added activity in Greenland within five (5) years of commencement of commercial production, unless otherwise modified in the licence with documented, objective justification and remediation measures. Specific targets beyond the five\u2011year baseline shall be set in individual licences and may include staged increases, local employment quotas, and supply\u2011chain localisation milestones.\n- Licensees failing materially to meet LVP KPIs shall be subject to corrective action plans, increased monitoring, financial penalties, and, for persistent failure, staged enforcement measures up to suspension or revocation.\n\nFinancing, Offtake, and Technology Safeguards:\n- Offtake agreements that cover more than 25% of the licensee\u2019s forecast annual production require prior written approval by the licensing authority. Approval shall be granted or denied within 45 calendar days of a materially complete offtake submission and may be conditioned on: (a) safeguards for technology and processing know\u2011how; (b) demonstrated measures preventing diversion of material to sanctioned or designated entities; and (c) provisions ensuring fulfilment of local\u2011value commitments.\n- Technology\u2011safeguard provisions shall include requirements for licensing or restriction of transfer of processing technology, intellectual\u2011property controls, and where appropriate, escrow arrangements for critical processing inputs or know\u2011how.\n- All material financing sources must be disclosed and are subject to the Enhanced Screening provisions below.\n\nEnhanced Screening and Mitigation for State\u2011Linked or Strategic Competitor Interests:\n- Projects financed, controlled, or materially influenced (by equity, debt, offtake, or other economic dependence) by state\u2011owned enterprises, state\u2011influenced entities, or entities from an Identified Strategic Competitor list shall be subject to enhanced review.\n- Enhanced review process: within 30 calendar days of a determination that enhanced review is applicable, the licensing authority shall provide the applicant a written list of specific national\u2011security, economic-security, and supply\u2011chain risks requiring mitigation. The applicant shall propose a Mitigation and Governance Plan within 60 calendar days. The licensing authority shall conclude enhanced review and issue a decision within 90 calendar days after receiving a materially complete Mitigation and Governance Plan.\n- Mitigation measures may include increased local ownership requirements, joint\u2011venture structures with Greenlandic partners, export and offtake controls, on\u2011site monitoring by designated authorities, technology access limitations, performance bonds, reduced royalty payments escrowed pending compliance, and, where mitigation is insufficient, rejection of the application.\n\nAudit Rights, Transparency, and Reporting:\n- Licensees shall deliver annual audited financial statements and compliance reports, within 90 days of fiscal year-end, to the licensing authority and to the Government of Denmark for matters within its oversight remit. Reports shall include production volumes, offtake counterparties, royalties and payments, and fulfilment of LVP KPIs (disaggregated by activity and location).\n- The licensing authority and the Government of Denmark shall have the right to conduct on\u2011site inspections and audits, with at least 72 hours\u2019 notice for routine inspections; shorter notice is permitted for exigent circumstances including safety, health, or security incidents. Confidential business information may be redacted for publication but shall be available to oversight authorities and, where relevant, to NATO under agreed confidentiality arrangements when defence implications exist.\n\nCompliance, Enforcement, Remedies, and Financial Safeguards:\n- Breaches of material licence conditions, including wilful misrepresentation, failure to meet agreed LVP KPIs without approved remediation, breach of offtake approval conditions, or material national\u2011security concerns, may result in administrative fines (set according to Greenlandic regulatory schedules), corrective orders, suspension of operations, revocation of licenses, escrow or forfeiture of royalties, and forfeiture of performance bonds.\n- Prior to grant of any licence, licensees shall establish a performance bond or other financial security instrument sufficient to guarantee reclamation, environmental remediation, payment of potential fines, and fulfilment of critical supply obligations; the licensing authority shall set the amount based on project scale and environmental risk.\n\nRevenue\u2011Sharing, Royalties, and Escrow Mechanisms:\n- Revenue\u2011sharing frameworks (including royalty rates and mechanisms for profit sharing with Greenland) shall be negotiated and, wherever possible, finalized within 180 calendar days of grant of licence. Absent finalized terms within 180 days, a default escrow mechanism shall apply whereby a minimum percentage of royalties (to be specified in the licence) is held in escrow pending final agreement; escrow funds shall be released or adjusted once negotiations conclude.\n\nCoordination with Defence, NATO, and Emergency Exceptions:\n- Where a project may materially affect defence access, basing arrangements, NATO infrastructure, or de\u2011escalation/notification protocols, the licensing authority must notify the Government of Denmark and NATO within seven (7) calendar days of determining the matter is material. The authority may impose additional security conditions, temporary restrictions on particular offtakes, or require immediate mitigation measures in consultation with Denmark and NATO.\n- In declared national emergency or urgent defence circumstances, the Government of Denmark, in consultation with Greenlandic authorities, may institute temporary measures that supersede certain licence conditions to secure defence or Alliance interests; such measures shall be proportionate, time\u2011limited, and accompanied by a plan to restore standard licensing arrangements.\n\nAppeal, Review, and Dispute Resolution:\n- Applicants and licensees shall have the right to an administrative appeal within 30 calendar days of a licensing decision per Greenlandic administrative law, and judicial review thereafter in Greenlandic courts. Licence terms may include mandatory arbitration clauses for commercial disputes consistent with domestic law but may not restrict judicial review of administrative licensing actions.\n\nTransitional and Implementation Provisions:\n- Existing licences in force at the time of adoption of this clause shall be reviewed against the Local Value Plan requirements at the time of the next licence renewal or within two (2) years, whichever occurs first. Any new incremental licence conditions imposed pursuant to this clause shall be proportionate and include a reasonable compliance timeline.\n\nExceptions and Confidentiality:\n- Confidential business information may be protected from public disclosure to the extent permitted by Greenlandic law; however, nondisclosure does not limit the obligation to provide full information to oversight authorities, the Government of Denmark, or NATO where defence or security implications exist.\n\nImplementation and Guidance:\n- The licensing authority, in coordination with the Government of Denmark, shall publish implementing regulations and procedural guidance within 90 calendar days of adoption of this clause to specify forms, timelines, fees, and template LVP/KPI requirements.\n\nReview Cycle:\n- The Governments of Greenland and Denmark shall jointly review the effectiveness of this clause and its implementing guidance no later than 24 months after adoption and periodically thereafter every three years, taking into account market conditions, technological developments, environmental safeguards, and Alliance security considerations.",

Include notification timeline, deconfliction/hotline, and oversight/inspection. Avoid operational overpromises; focus on approvals and mechanisms.\nRESOURCES_MINERALS requirements: Specify licensing criteria, screening, transparency, and audit rights. Cover offtake/processing, local value creation, and revenue/benefit sharing.\nENVIRONMENT_CLIMATE requirements: Specify ESIA/EIA standards, monitoring protocol, and no-go zones. Require remediation bonds and independent verification.\nHUMAN_RIGHTS_COMMUNITY requirements: Clarify FPIC vs consultation thresholds. Include grievance mechanism and community benefit agreements.\nCYBER_TECH requirements: Specify incident reporting, audits, and technology safeguards.\nNon-trivial factual claims include: force levels, basing rights, defense treaties, incident history; reserves, production volumes, licensing law, ownership structures; impact standards, protected area designations, emissions data; rights status, displacement figures, consultation outcomes; incident statistics, attribution claims, technical capabilities.\nClause checklist: scope, authority, timelines, compliance/enforcement, exceptions, reporting cadence.\nLegal hooks mentioned in scenario (do not assert beyond text): 1951 defense framework",
