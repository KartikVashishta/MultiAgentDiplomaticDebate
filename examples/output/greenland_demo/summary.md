# Debate Summary

**Scenario**: Greenland Security and Critical Minerals

**Countries**: Denmark, United States

**Rounds**: 3

**Total Sources**: 6

## Final Scores

- **Denmark**: 8.0/10 - Denmark presented a focused, sovereignty‑centred position that seeks concrete, enforceable mechanisms and robust local oversight—useful and constructive for durable agreements. The tone is firm but open to cooperation; however the statement is more condition‑heavy and less detailed on how it would operationalize consent or incentives for partners.
- **United States**: 9.0/10 - The U.S. balanced strategic necessity with respect for sovereignty and self‑determination, proposing a pragmatic, legally grounded framework with consent, notification, de‑escalation, and commitments on critical‑minerals benefits and safeguards—this advances negotiable, concrete options and lowers transaction costs for treaty formation.

## Treaty Status

- Accepted: 4
- Pending: 20
