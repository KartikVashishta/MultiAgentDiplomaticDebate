The government operates under a democratic framework established by the Constitution of India, adopted on January 26, 1950. This federal system divides powers between the central government and 28 states along with 8 union territories, allowing for both centralized and localized governance. Traditional governance systems and indigenous practices exist in some areas, often influenced by local customs and tribal laws. Additionally, religious and cultural influences play a significant role in Indian governance, as the country is home to diverse ethnic and religious communities, which can sometimes impact political dynamics. The Constitution also enshrines fundamental rights and duties, ensuring a framework for democracy and governance that reflects India's pluralistic society.",

    "colonial_history": "India's colonial history began with the arrival of the British East India Company, which was granted monopoly rights for trade in India in 1600. The company's influence expanded throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, culminating in significant control over Indian territories. The pivotal moment came in 1857 with the Sepoy Mutiny, which prompted the British government to dissolve the East India Company and establish direct British rule, known as the British Raj, from 1858 until India's independence in 1947. This period was marked by significant socio-political changes, economic exploitation, and resistance movements, including the notable nonviolent resistance led by figures like Mahatma Gandhi. The struggle for independence was characterized by various movements, including the Quit India Movement, highlighting the profound impact of British colonialism on India's history and subsequent development.",

    "evolution_of_foreign_policy": "India's foreign policy has evolved significantly since independence in 1947. Initially rooted in non-alignment during the Cold War, India sought to remain neutral and avoid alignment with either the USSR or the USA. This policy was maintained until the end of the Cold War in the 1990s. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, India transitioned towards strategic autonomy, focusing on economic diplomacy, security concerns, and global leadership. The 'Look East' policy was introduced to strengthen ties with Southeast Asia, reflecting a shift in India's approach to international relations. Under Prime Minister Modi, India's foreign policy has further transformed, emphasizing assertiveness and adaptability in a rapidly changing global landscape, while balancing relationships with major powers. Today, India's foreign policy is characterized by resilience, strategic thinking, and a pragmatic approach to global challenges."
