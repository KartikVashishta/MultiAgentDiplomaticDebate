    "government_type": "Italy is a parliamentary democratic republic, established on June 2, 1946, following the abolition of the monarchy through a popular referendum. The governance structure is decentralized, with regions having significant autonomy, indicating a regional system rather than a unitary one. The constitutional framework has evolved from historical roots dating back to the kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, which introduced a constitution in 1848. While Italy is predominantly secular, Roman Catholicism has historically influenced its cultural and political landscape. Additionally, for decades, the electoral system has utilized proportional representation, ensuring that political parties receive seats in accordance with the votes they garner.",

    "colonial_history": "Italy played a complex role in colonization, being the last European country to establish a colonial empire. Italy had colonies primarily in Africa and Asia, including present-day Libya, Eritrea, Somalia, and Ethiopia. Colonization efforts began late compared to other European nations due to Italy's unification in 1861. Italian colonialism included dismantling traditional governance systems in colonized regions, notably in Somalia. The invasion and occupation of Ethiopia starting in 1935 marked the last significant chapter of Italian colonial history, which ended with Italy's eviction from the Horn of Africa by British forces in 1941 during World War II.",

    "evolution_of_foreign_policy": "Italy's foreign policy has undergone significant evolution over the years, particularly from the era of Mussolini's expansionist ambitions in the early 20th century to the contemporary challenges faced by the Meloni government. During Mussolini's regime, Italy adopted an aggressive stance in the Mediterranean and Africa, aiming to revive the Roman Empire's influence. In contrast, the modern Italian foreign policy has shifted towards a more pragmatic and multilateral approach, focusing on cooperation within the European Union and addressing regional issues in the Mediterranean. The recent reports indicate a renewed emphasis on Italy's relationships with the Global South and a strategic prioritization of Mediterranean affairs, reflecting a response to shifting global dynamics. The foreign policy objectives have also been influenced by populist agendas, which seek to redefine Italy's role on the international stage while maintaining historical alliances. Overall, the trajectory from expansionism to a cooperative and pragmatic stance highlights Italy's adaptation to current geopolitical realities and domestic political pressures."

The rise of populism has also shaped voter orientations, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to shifts in perceptions of government accountability and effectiveness.
