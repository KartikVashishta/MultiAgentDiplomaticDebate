    "government_type": "Japan has a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy. The traditional governance system has evolved from the historical rule of the Emperor, who is now a symbolic figure, while actual political power resides with elected officials. The government operates under the Constitution of Japan, established in 1947, which emphasizes democratic principles and the rule of law. The National Diet serves as the legislative branch, comprising a House of Representatives (lower house) and a House of Councillors (upper house). Cultural influences, particularly Shinto and Buddhism, play a role in the country's political ethos, but Japan's modern governance is primarily secular. Local governments, including prefectural and municipal authorities, have administrative powers, reflecting a unitary system where the central government retains significant control.",

    "colonial_history": "Japan's colonial history began in the late 19th century, particularly after the Meiji Restoration in 1868, which aimed to modernize Japan and achieve parity with Western powers. Japan avoided European colonization and instead became an imperial power itself, expanding its influence in East Asia. The first significant act of imperialism was the annexation of Taiwan in 1895, followed by the colonization of Korea in 1910, which lasted until 1945. During this period, Japan imposed strict governance, suppressing freedoms and promoting assimilationist policies. The Japanese occupation of Korea was marked by efforts to exploit its resources and suppress Korean culture. Japan also established a military presence in parts of China, further expanding its empire. After Japan's defeat in World War II, it lost all its colonies and territories, entering a phase of occupation by the United States until 1952. This marked the end of Japan's imperial era, leading to a focus on economic and social development under a pacifist constitution.",

    "evolution_of_foreign_policy": "Japan's foreign policy has undergone significant transformation since the Meiji Restoration, evolving from a period of imperial expansion to a contemporary stance characterized by pacifism and economic diplomacy. Post-Cold War, Japan has faced new security threats that prompted a reevaluation of its role in international affairs. Under Prime Minister Abe Shinz≈ç, Japan sought to redefine its international presence by adopting a more proactive foreign policy, emphasizing contributions to global peace and security. The evolution reflects Japan's gradual adjustment to a multipolar world, with increased focus on strategic partnerships and regional engagement, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. Recent crises, such as the Ukraine conflict, have further influenced Japan's foreign policy direction, indicating a shift towards a more assertive posture in response to emerging global challenges."
