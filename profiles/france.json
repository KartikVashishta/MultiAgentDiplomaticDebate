    "government_type": "France operates a semi-presidential system, established under the Constitution of 1958, which emphasizes the separation of powers and citizen freedoms. It is a unitary state, meaning that the central government holds the primary authority, although it has decentralized some powers to regional authorities. There are no significant traditional or indigenous governance systems that influence the modern political framework. The governance is secular, reflecting Enlightenment ideals, but cultural influences remain strong, including the historical impact of Catholicism on French society. The government comprises an executive branch led by a President and a Prime Minister, a bicameral legislature (the National Assembly and the Senate), and an independent judiciary, all designed to protect individual rights and maintain democratic governance.",

    "colonial_history": "France's colonial history is characterized by its establishment of a vast empire from the 16th to the 20th centuries. Key regions included New France in North America, which encompassed Canada and Louisiana, and the French West Indies, including islands like Saint-Domingue, Guadeloupe, and Martinique. The French colonial empire was marked by a focus on the fur trade, particularly in Canada, where colonization began slowly but developed significantly over time. France's colonial ambitions were evident during the 17th and 18th centuries, particularly under Louis XIV, when it could have emerged as a leading European colonial power due to its wealth and military strength. However, its colonial policy was inconsistent, often overshadowed by European conflicts. France also engaged in colonization efforts in Africa, Asia, and Oceania, reflecting a complex and diverse colonial legacy that has evolved significantly over the years, influencing both metropolitan France and its former colonies.",

    ],
    "evolution_of_foreign_policy": "France's foreign policy has undergone significant changes over time, reflecting both historical contexts and contemporary challenges. After the defeat of 1871, France experienced diplomatic isolation in Europe, which Bismarck sought to mitigate through colonial expansion and alliances. In the early modern period, particularly under Louis XIV, France pursued a vigorous foreign policy aimed at dominating Europe, although interpretations of this ambition have varied. In recent years, particularly following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, France's foreign and security policy has seen gradual shifts, with an increasing alignment with Central European security perspectives. The evolving geopolitical landscape, marked by the war in Ukraine and the influence of external factors such as the U.S. under Donald Trump, has prompted France to reassess its strategic posture, leading to both continuity and change in its diplomatic approach. The current government faces immediate challenges in supporting Ukraine while navigating internal political dynamics, suggesting a complex interplay of continuity and strategic adaptation in France's foreign policy."
