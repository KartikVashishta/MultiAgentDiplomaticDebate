    "government_type": "Russia is a federal semi-presidential republic, characterized by a complex governance structure that includes both traditional and modern elements. The country is divided into federal subjects, which consist of republics, krais, oblasts, cities of federal significance, an autonomous oblast, and autonomous okrugs, each having equal rights as constituent entities. Historically, Russia's governance was influenced by the Soviet system, which structured it under a series of constitutions that emphasized a federal structure but were dominated by communist ideologies. Although the contemporary Russian government operates under a constitution established in 1993, its power dynamics reflect a strong central authority, often overshadowing the autonomy of its federal subjects. Additionally, the Russian Orthodox Church and various cultural influences play a significant role in shaping the governance landscape, intertwining religion with state affairs. Traditional governance systems among indigenous populations in Siberia and the Far East also contribute to the diversity of governance practices within the nation.",

    "colonial_history": "Russian imperialism spans several centuries, beginning with the Tsardom of Russia and continuing through the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, culminating in contemporary neo-imperialism. The Russian Empire was formally proclaimed under Peter the Great in 1721 and expanded significantly, covering about one-sixth of the world's landmass by the late 19th century. The conquest of Central Asia began with the capture of Tashkent in 1865, driven by a 'civilizing mission' ideology. Russian colonial practices involved military conquests, cultural assimilation through policies such as Russification, and the establishment of control over diverse ethnic groups. This history of conquest and colonial rule has often been overlooked in discussions of European colonialism, despite its significant impact on the regions affected and the ongoing debates regarding Russia's colonial legacy.",

    "evolution_of_foreign_policy": "Russia's foreign policy has evolved significantly since the early 1990s, marked by several distinct stages. Initially characterized by a pro-Western approach, it shifted to a more assertive stance as Russia sought to regain its status as a global power. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 marked a pivotal moment, leading to increased domestic support for Putin's foreign policy decisions, as evidenced by surveys indicating that a majority of Russians believe it brought more good than harm. This period has seen a tightening of foreign policy, justified by the Kremlin as a response to perceived threats from the West. In recent years, there has been a clear move towards establishing a multipolar world order, with Russia aiming to eliminate Western dominance in international affairs. The strategic narrative has shifted towards realism and a focus on geopolitical interests, especially in regions like the Black Sea. Overall, Russia's foreign policy reflects a transition from engagement with the West to a more confrontational and independent posture, driven by internal political dynamics and a desire for greater global influence."
